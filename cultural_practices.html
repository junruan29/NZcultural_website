                            <p>Maori statues are significant symbols of New Zealand's Maori culture, often used to represent the history, beliefs, and social structure of the Maori people. These statues are commonly found in traditional Maori buildings, such as wharenui (meeting houses), and in public monuments. They are typically carved from wood and feature unique designs with curves, spirals, and intricate geometric patterns.</p>

                            <p>The Haka is a traditional dance of the Maori people, characterized by vigorous movements, chanting, and singing. It is used to display strength, courage, and unity. Historically performed before battles, it now plays a key role in celebrations, welcoming ceremonies, and other cultural events.</p>

                            <p>Poi were originally created to improve male warriors' coordination and arm strength. Over time, poi became part of kapa haka—traditional Māori performing arts. Today, poi is performed by women to showcase dexterity and creativity, and its influence has extended globally in performance arts.</p>
