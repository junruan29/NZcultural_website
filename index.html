                <h2>Māori Cultural Experience</h2>
                <p>Maori are the indigenous people of Aotearoa New Zealand. You can now enjoy a Maori cultural experience in Whangarei. On the basis of oral records, archaeological finds and genetic analyses, historians place the arrival of Maori in New Zealand around the 13th century. Their story is both long and intriguing.<br>
                The origin of Maori has been reliably traced to the islands of Eastern Polynesia. Their journey to New Zealand occurred in a number of epic waka (canoe) voyages over a significant period of time.<br>
                Contemporary Maori culture has been shaped by the traditions of its rich cultural heritage.  Within any Māori community, the marae provides a focus for social, cultural and spiritual life.<br>
                Māori is an oral culture rich with stories and legends. There are several specific areas of Northland where you can experience this intriguing culture first hand.<br>
